<p>Welcome to Wiretap Roulette! Here's how to play:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Make sure</strong> your smart speaker is within earshot of your device, and that
    voice recognition is turned off on your smart speaker.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Click roll</strong> to send a random commend to your smart speaker.</li>
  <li><strong>If you chicken out, tap "give up" to see your score and end the game.</li>
  <li>
    If you didn't panic and cancel the command, <strong>tap "did it"</strong> to rack up some
    sweet, sweet points and continue the game.
  </li>
</ol>
